/*Inheritance in ES6


In a real-time strategy video game there are 2 types of units: gunner and sniper.
The program you are given declares a standard Unit class. It has an attack() method, which displays Ð¼essage "Attack!".
You need to inherit Gunner and Sniper classes from the Unit class, and add attack() method to each so that the given function calls work correctly: each method should call the attack() method of parent class Unit, and then output to the console its own corresponding message:
Gunner => "Using gun!"
Sniper = "Using sniper rifle!"

For example, gunner.attack() should output
Attack!
Using gun!

where "Attack!" is message form attack() method of parent class Unit, and "Using gun!" is its own message.*/

class Unit {
  attack() {
    console.log("Attack!");
  }
}

class Gunner extends Unit{

    attack() {
       super.attack();
       console.log("Using gun!")
        
  }
}

class Sniper extends Unit{
    attack(){
       super.attack();
       console.log("Using sniper rifle!");
        
        
    }
}

let gunner = new Gunner();
let sniper = new Sniper();

gunner.attack();
sniper.attack();
