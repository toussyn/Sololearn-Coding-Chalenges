Break and continue


Many tall buildings, including hotels, skip the number 13 when numbering floors -- often going from floor 12 to floor 14. It is thought that the number 13 is unlucky.
Write a program that will number 15 rooms starting from 1, skipping the number 13. Output to the console each room number in separate line.

for(i = 1; i <= countOfRooms + 1; i++){
   if (i === 13){

   }
 console.log(i);
